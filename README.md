## About
I began my professional career as a programmer in 2008 by entering the Southern Federal University of Rostov-on-Don. I earned the first money for writing computer programs as a student in the 3rd year of university. After graduation, I settled in a local organization and there I was engaged in supporting a billing system completely written in the oracle database. Then, having quit, I decided to start continuing the way of a backend developer and now I am an engineer at avito.ru, but before that, I managed to be the head of a small team of developers working full-time remotely in an American company.  
  
Now I’m interested in start-ups, especially in the field of finance, bioTech, construction or creating software for highly specialized areas such as air communications or sea transport. I will be glad to any dialogue, acquaintance.  
In my arsenal I prefer to use the following technology stack: PHP (Laravel), goLang, MySQL / Postgres, k8s, docker, cloud systems like aws, react / redux, reactNative
